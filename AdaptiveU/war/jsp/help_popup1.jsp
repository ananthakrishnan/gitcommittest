			             					Adaptive Course is a web-based employee assessment and tracking application. With fun and encouraging features, it helps you (as admin/coach) award performance badges, trophies, and prizes to your users/employees when they successfully complete tasks like watching product videos, reporting application bugs, scoring well in typing tests, and more. For example, a user wanting to earn a typing badge would have to watch all the typing videos.
			             				</p>
			             				<p>
			             					Every badge is distinct and rated with different points. Adaptive Course users who score more points can earn interesting prizes like yummy food (from KFC, McDonalds and the like), days off and T-shirts. Team Leads can use this application to periodically review team members and award cash/badges/trophies/prizes for high performance.
